# PATH

## Need to make this more dynamic, as some systems may not have all these apps installed,
## or they may be installed in different directories. 
## Not sure how I want to organize that yet however. 
## For example my laptop doesn't have neovim or android studio installed. 

NEOVIM="${HOME}/apps/neovim/bin/"
VLANG="${HOME}/.vlang/v/"
GOLANG="/usr/local/go/bin"
ANDROID_STUDIO="${HOME}/android-studio/bin"
MODULAR_HOME="${HOME}/.modular"
MOJO_BIN="pkg/packages.modular.com_mojo/bin"
USR_LOCAL="/usr/local"
SNAP="/snap/bin"
KOTLINBIN="${HOME}/.sdkman/candidates/kotlin/current/bin/"
# Normal paths that should be available.
export PATH=$USR_LOCAL/sbin:$USR_LOCAL/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:$USR_LOCAL/games:$SNAP

# Additional paths for various software. 
export PATH=$PATH:$MODULAR_HOME/$MOJO_BIN:$LOCALBIN:$VLANG:$ANDROID_STUDIO:$NEOVIM:$GOLANG:$KOTLINBIN
